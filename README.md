# The Backrooms Java Game
My text based adventure game is based on the game play style of Zork and the Internet legend of The Backrooms (a psychological horror)

Zork was a classic 80s text adventure which boasted several sequels. It was written in MDL (Muddle). 

My game is written in Java, while not a conventional choice for a video game, I wanted to test my skills with the language and see what I could do in the 
constraints of the console. I think great stories can be told no matter how good or bad the graphics are, or in my case, nonexistent.

The Zip file can be imported via Eclipse (recommended) and played via the console.

If you do not have Eclipse, the jar can be executed via the terminal (some characters will be unrecognized and represented by a question mark in this format
but the game is still playable).

Note that for both these methods you will need the latest JDK installed which at the time of writing this, is version 18.

For the jar file you will navigate in the terminal to the directory in which you downloaded it. Run the following command:
```
java -jar theBackroomsFinalRunnable.jar 
```

Similar to Zork, type help if you need help while playing.

Thank you to my AP Computer Science teacher for giving me the skills I needed to make this possible
