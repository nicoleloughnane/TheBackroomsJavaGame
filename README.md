# TheBackroomsJavaGame
My text based adventure game is based on the game play style of Zork and the Internet legend of The Backrooms.
Zork was a classic 80s text adventure which boasted several sequels. It was written in MDL (Muddle). 
While Java is not a conventional choice for a video game, I wanted to test my skills with the language and see what is possible.
The Zip file can be imported via Eclipse (recommended) and played via the console.
If you do not have Eclipse, the jar can be executed via the terminal (some characters will be unrecognized and represented by a question mark in this format
but the game is still playable)
Similar to Zork, type help if you need help while playing.
